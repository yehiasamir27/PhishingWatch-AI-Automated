# Phishing Campaign Model — SOAR Workflow

![n8n workflow](docs/images/workflow.png)

Delivered a production-style anti-phishing SOAR automation that turns raw email content into an evidence-backed decision and a ready-to-share incident report — without manual SOC copy/paste.

## Problem solved
Phishing triage is usually slow and inconsistent: analysts must read emails, judge risk from wording, extract URLs, check VirusTotal, gather context, and then write both technical and executive summaries. This project automates that workflow to reduce triage time, standardize decisions, and produce consistent reports while keeping VirusTotal as the authoritative evidence source for URL verdicts.

## What the solution does (end-to-end)
### 1) Email → ML scoring (content-driven)
- The email (subject, sender, body) is normalized and scored using a DistilBERT phishing classifier deployed as a FastAPI microservice on Railway, integrated into n8n Cloud.
- Each input produces its own confidence/accuracy score (observed outputs reach ~99.6% and up to 100% on clear cases).

### 2) URL extraction → VirusTotal evidence
- Extracts URL(s) from the email body and queries VirusTotal for reputation and vendor detections to drive an evidence-first classification.

### 3) Hacker News enrichment (context)
- Adds up to 3 relevant security references from Hacker News for context (enrichment only — not used to decide the verdict).

### 4) Automated reporting (technical + non-technical)
Generates two aligned outputs:
- Technical Incident Response report grounded in VirusTotal evidence (with MITRE mapping when supported)
- Non-technical executive summary suitable for stakeholders

### 5) Automation-ready output
Returns a structured JSON response containing:
- ML verdict + confidence
- Extracted indicators (URLs)
- VirusTotal evidence
- Optional Hacker News references
- Generated reports
This output is ready to plug into alerts, ticketing, or email notifications.
